Encapsulation :

Based on the Encapsulation value of the component the style of the component is scoped.

Default : Emulate => style is scoped to specific component it will not create shadow

ShadowDown => style is scoped and it will create shadow so that child component with none Encapsulation will apply same style as parent if child has no specific style

None => style is not scoped to specific component it will  apply to all the components whose encapsulation is none or ShadowDown


Recommended : default encapsulation
