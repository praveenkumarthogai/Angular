Need of ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush : Suppose we have more nested components ( i.e child or sub child components) and it has no dependency on parent component, when parent component has a change detection
it makes all the child and subchild components to renrender unneccesarily to resolve this ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush comes into the picture. 

@Component({
changeDetection:ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})

when you add changeDetection:ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush inside the component decorator then the change detection doesn't run automatically anymore. 

Instead, it listens Only for specific changes
*) On @Input changes
*) On @Output Emitter Events
*) | async pipe when it receives observables
*) explicitely registering the component to be checked using ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(); 


Note : when @Input Data is in type of array or object don't mutate the value always re assign the value else change detection will not work.
